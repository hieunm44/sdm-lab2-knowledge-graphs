It does this by synthesising rigorous coverage of methodologies with an accessible \u2018real-world\u2019 approach. The text follows course learning objectives for undergraduates in business and provides examples drawn from the full range of business subjects from marketing and strategy to human resource management. The text has unique features: for example, it introduces the four frameworks approach to the research project. The four frameworks approach provides beginner researchers, as well as more advanced researchers, with a simple model that will guide them in the development of their research projects. It facilitates researchers in the task of developing properly focused, fully integrated research projects. The textbook is very sympathetic to the challenges facing a student engaging with the subject for the first time and provides an integrated and balanced approach to quantitative and qualitative research. The writing is simple and direct and the examples and case studies presented were selected particularly with an undergraduate readership in mind. In summary, the text provides a unique and simple yet comprehensive introduction to research methods for business students. Business Research Methods is a valuable resource for all undergraduate business students, particularly for secondand third-year students on business research methods courses. It provides an excellent introduction to the work of undertaking research in an academic environment. This text is essential reading for all business students required to undertake research projects. Postgraduate students, and indeed students from other nonbusiness disciplines, will also find the text very helpful.

Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A research and education are identified.

This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are defined and described in terms of their key characteristics and capabilities. Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A research and education are identified. We also report a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications, researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade of related academic and industry publications. Finally, the six articles that comprise this special issue are introduced and characterized in terms of the proposed BI&A research framework.", "_authors": [{"_data": {"authorId": "47666658", "name": "Hsinchun Chen"}, "_affiliations": null, "_authorId": "47666658", "_citationCount": null, "_externalIds": null, "_hIndex": null, "_homepage": null, "_name": "Hsinchun Chen", "_paperCount": null, "_papers": null, "_url": null}, {"_data": {"authorId": "145802082", "name": "R.

However, the economic performance of firms does not depend simply on whether or not its strategies create such markets, but also on the cost of implementing those strategies. Clearly, if the cost of strategy implementation is greater than returns obtained from creating an imperfectly competitive product market, then firms will not obtain above normal economic performance from their strategizing efforts. To help analyze the cost of implementing strategies, we introduce the concept of a strategic factor market, i.e., a market where the resources necessary to implement a strategy are acquired. If strategic factor markets are perfect, then the cost of acquiring strategic resources will approximately equal the economic value of those resources once they are used to implement product market strategies. Even if such strategies create imperfectly competitive product markets, they will not generate above normal economic performance for a firm, for their full value would have been anticipated when the resources necessary for implementation were acquired. However, strategic factor markets will be imperfectly competitive when different firms have different expectations about the future value of a strategic resource. In these settings, firms may obtain above normal economic performance from acquiring strategic resources and implementing strategies. We show that other apparent strategic factor market imperfections, including when a firm already controls all the resources needed to implement a strategy, when a firm controls unique resources, when only a small number of firms attempt to implement a strategy, and when some firms have access to lower cost capital than others, and so on, are all special cases of differences in expectations held by firms about the future value of a strategic resource. Firms can attempt to develop better expectations about the future value of strategic resources by analyzing their competitive environments or by analyzing skills and capabilities they already control. Environmental analysis cannot be expected to improve the expectations of some firms better than others, and thus cannot be a source of more accurate expectations about the future value of a strategic resource. However, analyzing a firm's skills and capabilities can be a source of more accurate expectations.

We identify important avenues for future research and show how the complexity theory, innovation, and other streams of literature can help overcome many of the gaps in the BMI literature.", "_authors": [{"_data": {"authorId": "8649944", "name": "N.

The methodological basis for this work is design science, where the researcher builds an artifact to solve a specific problem. In this case the aim is to provide an ontology that makes it possible to explicit a firm's business model. In other words, the proposed artifact helps a firm to formally describe its value proposition, its customers, the relationship with them, the necessary intra- and inter-firm infrastructure and its profit model. Such an ontology is relevant because until now there is no model that expresses a company's global business logic from a pure business point of view. Previous models essentially take an organizational or process perspective or cover only parts of a firm's business logic. The four main pillars of the ontology, which are inspired by management science and enterprise- and processmodeling, are product, customer interface, infrastructure and finance. The ontology is validated by case studies, a panel of experts and managers. The dissertation also provides a software prototype to capture a company's business model in an information system.

From supermarket shelves to advertising agencies, the ability to offer vast choice is changing everything, and causing us to rethink where our markets lie and how to get to them. Unlimited selection is revealing truths about what consumers want and how they want to get it, from DVDs at Netflix to songs on iTunes to advertising on Google. However, this is not just a virtue of online marketplaces; it is an example of an entirely new economic model for business, one that is just beginning to show its power. After a century of obsessing over the few products at the head of the demand curve, the new economics of distribution allow us to turn our focus to the many more products in the tail, which collectively can create a new market as big as the one we already know. The Long Tail is really about the economics of abundance.

Unlimited selection is revealing truths about what consumers want and how they want to get it, from DVDs at Netflix to songs on iTunes to advertising on Google. However, this is not just a virtue of online marketplaces; it is an example of an entirely new economic model for business, one that is just beginning to show its power. After a century of obsessing over the few products at the head of the demand curve, the new economics of distribution allow us to turn our focus to the many more products in the tail, which collectively can create a new market as big as the one we already know. The Long Tail is really about the economics of abundance. New efficiencies in distribution, manufacturing, and marketing are essentially resetting the definition of what\u2019s commercially viable across the board. If the 20th century was about hits, the 21st will be equally about niches.", "_authors": [{"_data": {"authorId": "2242457507", "name": "Chris Anderson"}, "_affiliations": null, "_authorId": "2242457507", "_citationCount": null, "_externalIds": null, "_hIndex": null, "_homepage": null, "_name": "Chris Anderson", "_paperCount": null, "_papers": null, "_url": null}], "_citationCount": 2391, "_citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Anderson2006TheLT,\n author = {Chris Anderson},\n title = {The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More},\n year = {2006}\n}\n"}, "_citations": null, "_corpusId": 21949529, "_embedding": null, "_externalIds": {"MAG": "2138899136", "CorpusId": 21949529}, "_fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "_influentialCitationCount": 173, "_isOpenAccess": false, "_journal": {"_data": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "_name": "", "_pages": null, "_volume": ""}, "_openAccessPdf": null, "_paperId": "37875c9bb4159639d77bf0f7188ff23d593850d2", "_publicationDate": {"year": 2006, "month": 7, "day": 11}, "_publicationTypes": null, "_publicationVenue": null, "_referenceCount": 2, "_references": null, "_s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Engineering", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Economics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "_title": "The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More", "_tldr": null, "_venue": "", "_year": 2006, "_url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37875c9bb4159639d77bf0f7188ff23d593850d2"}, {"_data": {"paperId": "46514325524c3841be258f71893cc69f4d917596", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2165086204", "DOI": "10.1016/J.LRP.2010.01.004", "CorpusId": 20761986}, "corpusId": 20761986, "publicationVenue": null, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46514325524c3841be258f71893cc69f4d917596", "title": "From Strategy to Business Models and onto Tactics", "abstract": null, "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 42, "citationCount": 2214, "influentialCitationCount": 153, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2010-04-01", "journal": {"name": "Long Range Planning", "pages": "195-215", "volume": "43"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Casadesus-Masanell2010FromST,\n author = {R.

"abstract": "Abstract The adoption of cutting-edge technologies to steer business activities during community lockdown to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, even if involuntarily, provides evidence that technologies not only offer competitive advantages but also provides a means for survival, by improvising existing business models. In June 2019, we issued a call for papers to address the awareness, adoption, and implementation challenges of technologies that can drive businesses of all sizes in the fourth industrial revolution. We intended to identify as critical elements the \u201cmust-have\u201d and a \u201cnice to have\u201d technologies for small businesses and innovation. Then the ongoing COVID-19 global health pandemic struck in December 2019, forcing the need for digitization of business activities and remote operations, which was considered a \u201cnice to have\u201d to immediately become a \u201ccritical to have\u201d to survive in the ever increasingly uncertain business environment.

In June 2019, we issued a call for papers to address the awareness, adoption, and implementation challenges of technologies that can drive businesses of all sizes in the fourth industrial revolution. We intended to identify as critical elements the \u201cmust-have\u201d and a \u201cnice to have\u201d technologies for small businesses and innovation. Then the ongoing COVID-19 global health pandemic struck in December 2019, forcing the need for digitization of business activities and remote operations, which was considered a \u201cnice to have\u201d to immediately become a \u201ccritical to have\u201d to survive in the ever increasingly uncertain business environment. This paper identifies the technologies, evaluates disruptive software platforms, and strategies needed for creating and managing small business innovation and highlighting the complexity of that process and the context within which this process takes place. We integrate this discussion alongside a summary of the articles included in the Special Issue. The current realities show that technologies that enable social business creation, customer relationship management systems, new communications channels, virtual reality technologies for remote operations, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are crucial to lowering the costs of doing business.

It is frequently confused with other popular terms in the management literature such as strategy, business concept, revenue model, economic model or even business process modeling. Our findings suggest that while business model describes what an organization currently is, it needs to be complemented with a strategy and capabilities in order to face upcoming changes. Besides clarifying the meaning and use of the business model terminology, we theorize about its roots through a combination of the resource-based view and transaction cost economics.

Our findings suggest that while business model describes what an organization currently is, it needs to be complemented with a strategy and capabilities in order to face upcoming changes. Besides clarifying the meaning and use of the business model terminology, we theorize about its roots through a combination of the resource-based view and transaction cost economics.

Important transactions not in the ordinary course of business are handled by a detailed contract. For example, recently the Empire State Building was sold for $65 million. More than 100 attorneys, representing thirty-four parties, produced a 400-page contract. Another example is found in the agreement of a major rubber company in the United States to give technical assistance to a Japanese firm.

So begins this astonishingly blunt and timely manifesto by leading business thinker Jim Collins. Rejecting the belief, common among politicians, that all would be well in society if only the public sector operated more like the private sector, he sets out a radically new approach to creating successful hospitals, police forces, universities, charities, and other non-profit-making organisations.

This is manifest in an increasing number of family business studies published in top-tier management journals (e.g., Kotlar, Signori, De Massis, & Vismara, 2018; Neckebrouck, Schulze, & Zellweger, 2018) and an accumulating body of knowledge about the distinctive characteristics and behaviors of family enterprises and the outcomes of such behaviors. However, many of the mechanisms driving family business phenomena involve the micro-level of analysis, and family business researchers have yet to fully embrace this level of analysis in order to build more sophisticated and more robust theory. In this essay, we highlight and explain the need to apply a microfoundational lens in order to build and test theory that allows scholars to extend, enrich, and refine current knowledge on family enterprises. We also offer specific suggestions concerning how scholars can draw on microfoundations to advance family business research. While microfoundations has swept across (macro-) management research over the past decade or so (Barney & Felin, 2013; Felin & Foss, 2005; Felin, Foss, & Ployhart, 2015; Gavetti, 2005), it has so far had little impact on family business research.

In general, microfoundations are about explaining macro-level phenomena in terms of the actions and interactions of lower level entities. Thus, microfoundational explanations are reductionist and mechanism based. In social science, the micro typically (but not necessarily) involves individuals and their interactions, the macro may be, for example, firm-level outcomes, and furnishing microfoundations then means providing a theoretically informed explanation of how firm-level outcomes emerge from the characteristics, behaviors, and interactions of individuals (Felin et al., 2015). Although family business research has substantially increased in rigor over the years, much research on family business phenomena still does not specify theoretically and empirically the mechanisms of choice and action at the levels of analysis lower than that of the phenomenon itself. Ignoring the micro level is problematic because the predictions of our theory for macro-level phenomena may be wrong or incomplete (Coleman, 1990).

The model has three key elements: variable capital utilization, adjustment costs to investment, and preferences that exhibit a weak short-run wealth effect on the labour supply.

In this paper, we consider this problem to be measurement related, and propose and test a new process-oriented methodology for ex post measurement to audit IT impacts on a strategic business unit SBU or profit center's performance. The IT impacts on a given SBU are measured relative to a group of SBUs in the industry. The methodology involves a two-stage analysis of intermediate and higher level output variables that also accounts for industry and economy wide exogenous variables for tracing and measuring IT contributions. The data for testing the proposed model were obtained from SBUs in the manufacturing sector. Our results show significant positive impacts of IT at the intermediate level. The theoretical contribution of the study is a methodology that attempts to circumvent some of the measurement problems in this domain. It also provides a practical management tool to address the question of why or why not certain IT impacts occur. Additionally, through its process orientation, the suggested approach highlights key variables that may require managerial attention and subsequent action.", "venue": "Information systems research", "year": 1995, "referenceCount": 34, "citationCount": 1261, "influentialCitationCount": 76, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics", "Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Economics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "1995-03-01", "journal": {"name": "Inf.

In this paper, we consider this problem to be measurement related, and propose and test a new process-oriented methodology for ex post measurement to audit IT impacts on a strategic business unit SBU or profit center's performance. The IT impacts on a given SBU are measured relative to a group of SBUs in the industry. The methodology involves a two-stage analysis of intermediate and higher level output variables that also accounts for industry and economy wide exogenous variables for tracing and measuring IT contributions. The data for testing the proposed model were obtained from SBUs in the manufacturing sector. Our results show significant positive impacts of IT at the intermediate level. The theoretical contribution of the study is a methodology that attempts to circumvent some of the measurement problems in this domain. It also provides a practical management tool to address the question of why or why not certain IT impacts occur. Additionally, through its process orientation, the suggested approach highlights key variables that may require managerial attention and subsequent action.", "_authors": [{"_data": {"authorId": "1853976", "name": "A.

The reasons for that are, of course, the Internet and the World Wide Web, which are making electronic commerce much more accessible. They offer easily usable and low cost forms of electronic commerce. Electronic commerce on the basis of the Internet is set to become a very important way of doing business. Forrester (1997) forecasts that business-to-business (B-to-B) electronic commerce will grow to $327 billion in the year 2002 \u2014 that is the value of goods and services traded via the Internet. This excludes the value of the hardware, software and services that are needed to perform electronic commerce, whose value is estimated at several hundred billions of dollars likewise. Between 1996 and 1997 electronic commerce has been growing at over 1000 percent per year. While such high growth rates will not be sustained, it is clear that electronic commerce will become pervasive: Datamonitor (1997) expects in 5 years time 630,000 US companies and 245,000 European companies to be involved in full-fledged integrated B-to-B electronic commerce. The Report on Electronic Commerce (1998) expects that the business-to-business penetration rate will grow from 10% in 1997 to 90% in 2001. Although the number of consumers on the Net by the year 2000 could be several 100 millions it is expected that business-to-business will constitute the larger part of electronic commerce.

The reasons for that are, of course, the Internet and the World Wide Web, which are making electronic commerce much more accessible. They offer easily usable and low cost forms of electronic commerce. Electronic commerce on the basis of the Internet is set to become a very important way of doing business. Forrester (1997) forecasts that business-to-business (B-to-B) electronic commerce will grow to $327 billion in the year 2002 \u2014 that is the value of goods and services traded via the Internet. This excludes the value of the hardware, software and services that are needed to perform electronic commerce, whose value is estimated at several hundred billions of dollars likewise. Between 1996 and 1997 electronic commerce has been growing at over 1000 percent per year. While such high growth rates will not be sustained, it is clear that electronic commerce will become pervasive: Datamonitor (1997) expects in 5 years time 630,000 US companies and 245,000 European companies to be involved in full-fledged integrated B-to-B electronic commerce. The Report on Electronic Commerce (1998) expects that the business-to-business penetration rate will grow from 10% in 1997 to 90% in 2001. Although the number of consumers on the Net by the year 2000 could be several 100 millions it is expected that business-to-business will constitute the larger part of electronic commerce. With the new medium \u2014 the Internet \u2013 also new ways of doing business are developing. Most of those that capture the public attention are consumer-oriented (such as Amazon.com, Tesco).

The key features of the proposed book are: * Critical reviews of the major measurement frameworks available today - including the balanced scorecard, the business excellence model and shareholder value analysis. * Introduction of a new measurement framework - the performance prism - that addresses the shortcomings of the exisiting measurement frameworks. * Explanation of the tools, techniques and methodologies that can be used to measure stakeholder satisfaction, strategies, processes, capabilities and stakeholder contribution - the five facets of the performance prism. * Explanation of how managers can make the most of their measurement data. Specific discussions about how managers can analyse business performance data and identify appropriate improvement priorities. OUTLINE Chapter 1 - The Measurement Crisis This chapter will explore why measurement is on management's agenda and review recent developments in the field. A key theme in the chapter will be the changing nature of the measurement crisis. In the 1980s, when people first started worrying about the effectiveness of their measurement systems, the problem was that we were measuring the wrong things. Today the problem is that we are measuring too much. The chapter will explore this theme and encourage management to take a step back and think clearly about what they want from their measurement systems. Chapter 2 - The Measurement Frameworks This chapter will review the major measurement frameworks that are available today and identify their strengths and weaknesses. Frameworks to be covered will include the balanced scorecard, the business excellence model, shareholder value. A key theme that will run throughout the chapter will be the fact that each of these measurement frameworks offers a partial view of business performance. Chapter 3 - The Performance Prism This chapter will introduce a new, comprehensive measurement framework - the performance prism. The prism looks at measurement from a stakeholder perspective. When deciding what to measure managers have to first identify who their stakeholders are and what they want and need. Only then can they begin to decide what they should measure. Many of the existing works on measurement fail to recognise this, with numerous authors suggesting that measures should be derived from strategy. Measures should be consistent with strategy, but they should not be derived from strategy. Organisations have strategies because they want to deliver value to stakeholders. Hence the starting point for any discussion of measurement has to be stakeholders. The chapter on the performance prism will build upon this theme and explain how the performance prism provides a structure that encourages managers to answer five inter-related questions when designing their measurement systems: * Stakeholder satisfaction - who are the stakeholders and what do they want and need? * Strategies - what strategies do we need to deliver value to stakeholders? * Processes - what processes do we require to deliver these strategies? * Capabilities - what capabilities do we require to execute these processes? * Stakeholder contribution - what do we want and need from our stakeholders to enable all of the above to happen? Chapter 4 - Measuring Stakeholder Satisfaction This chapter will explore developments in the measurement of stakeholder satisfaction - investors, customers, employees, suppliers, regulators and local communities. Chapter 5 - Measuring Strategies This chapter will explore developments in the measurement of strategy - especially execution and effectiveness. Chapter 6 - Measuring Processes This chapter will explore developments in the measurement of processes - especially those associated with generating demand, fulfilling demand, developing new products and services and planning and managing the enterprise. Chapter 7 - Measuring Capabilities This chapter will explore developments in the measurement of capabilities - combinations of technology, people, practices and infrastructure. Chapter 8 - Measuring Stakeholder Contribution This chapter will explore developments in the measurement of stakeholder contribution - investment levels, customer and employee loyalty, supplier performance. Chapter 9 - Analysing Performance Data This chapter will build on the previous chapters by illustrating how performance data can be analysed once the data has been captured. Various tools, techniques and methodologies will be discussed and explained. There will be a strong emphasis throughout the chapter on the practicalities of making the most of measurement data. Chapter 10 - Improving Business Performance This chapter will concentrate on how to drive improvements in business performance following a systematic analysis of the data. Practical examples will be offered throughout that will illustrate how particular firms have used their measurement data. Appendix - The Measures Catalogue The authors have been working together over a period of months to construct a catalogue of best practice performance measures that identifies specific measures of performance that organisations can use to monitor their progress. The catalogue is structured around the performance prism framework and is currently available on the web (www.cranfield.ac.uk/som/cbp).

It represents a new way to understand data and generate information that has never been available before-a way for businesses to view the future and to understand and anticipate the likely effects of their decisions on their markets and industries. It thus promises to have far-reaching effects on the way that businesses in many areas use computers to support practical decision-making.

To examine how e-business value is influenced by economic environments, we compare two subsamples from developed and developing countries.

(2) Firm size is negatively related to e-business value, suggesting that structural inertia associated with large firms tends to retard e-business value. (3) Competitive pressure often drives firms to adopt e-business, but e-business value is associated more with internal organizational resources (e.g., technological readiness) than with external pressure to adopt. (4) While financial resources are an important factor in developing countries, technological capabilities become far more important in developed countries. This suggests that as firms move into deeper stages of e-business transformation, the key determinant of e-business value shifts from monetary spending to higher dimensions of organizational capabilities.

Applying Information systems to heterogeneous and distributed environments is one of the current research areas. Business Process Management Systems is the information systems which deal with the administration of tasks in the business processes, organizational structures, or in the related context. The Workflow Management system, the early idea of BPM, controls the workflow in an organization, data transfer, and integration of legacy information systems with existing programs and program modules, delegation of business tasks. Offering task management services especially modeling of business processes and underlying organizations, BPM serves it meaning and incorporates the WFM system. BPM supporting the use of knowledge concerning the awareness/unawareness of integrated software, and analysis of processes and organizational structure in terms of verification, modification, evaluation are key management in BPM system I.INTRODUCTION TO BPM: Combination of corporate restructuring and mergers urged the department and processes to be automated and linked together. Unfortunately it created largely disconnected spaghetti of systems and applications. Business Process Management (BPM) was born from a strong need to streamline internal processes and connections between both internal and external functions. It provides ability to model, monitor, manage and manipulate processes quickly in response to changes in strategy and market forces. BPM is an extension of classical Work Flow Management (WFM) systems and approaches. BPM delivers the maximum utility of legacy system. It is a method for revolutionizing the way the work moves throughout an organization. II.COMPONENTS OF BPM: The four key elements in Business Process Management are: Process modeling, Process rule, Process management, and Process performance analytics. Process modeling: Process modeling describes the flow of information (business process).It helps in building a model of process and mapping into an implementation frame work. Modeling requires a consistent analysis and representation of the processes. It forms the basis for the userspecific process environment. Process Rule: Process Rule is a heart of the BPM. It involves execution of discrete steps & integration of information. A process rules engine is used for this purpose. The engine is to monitor and manage the given steps by providing a flow control over the business process. If a process fails or delayed, a compensated action can be done to rectify. Process Management: Process Management is to correlate business/application events to fundamental business metrics .It enables the organization to monitor and optimize the business process. Once the process has been analyzed, modeled and the associated rules are formed. The next stage involves the visualization and management. Visualization means transaction data ranging from holistic to process-state or client state specific rules. Process Performance Analytics: Process Performance Analytics is a transition data source available for sophisticated management analytics .This data should be available on a retrospective or real-time basis. It should answer to one of the most difficult question like \u201chow much does it cost to process a specific transaction?\u201d By this way BPM mainly addresses four components. They are Work Flow Management, Content and records management Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and Business Activity monitoring (BAM). III.RELEVENCE TO SYSTEM INTEGRATION: BPM can be fitted easily on the top of existing IT system. It is the Process rules that governs all the happenings and optimizes the process. BPM will not be able to work without the connectivity provided by the EAI layer. EAI layer provides BPM to gain and measure the value from the investment. On the other hand, BPM provides value to the EAI technology layer of Information technology. BPM layer offers business management the view of the message processing layer. It is used to unlock the value of the information held in the integration layer. It is also used to gather data of every transaction in the lifecycle. IV.APPLICATION OF BPM: BPM can be applied to any application which needs these advantages. BPM reduces unnecessary high losses in time critical transactions, helps to provide any critical information, practical application yield fast ROI ,better control over the information, identifying and maximizing the benefits faster, better analysis and tracking, provides enterprise-wide visibility of business processes, improve the effectiveness of the core operations, provides ability to coordinate interactions between information systems, business process and the people, flexible and easily changed by non-technical business people.", "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 10, "citationCount": 731, "influentialCitationCount": 57, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm:978-3-540-31929-0/1?pdf=chapter%20toc", "status": "GREEN"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business", "Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Business", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2006-10-09", "journal": {"name": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Guizzardi2006BusinessPM,\n author = {G.

Should it be? Can it be? This major work of social and intellectual history reveals how such questions have driven business education and shaped American management and society for more than a century. The book is also a call for reform. Rakesh Khurana shows that university-based business schools were founded to train a professional class of managers in the mold of doctors and lawyers but have effectively retreated from that goal, leaving a gaping moral hole at the center of business education and perhaps in management itself. Khurana begins in the late nineteenth century, when members of an emerging managerial elite, seeking social status to match the wealth and power they had accrued, began working with major universities to establish graduate business education programs paralleling those for medicine and law. Constituting business as a profession, however, required codifying the knowledge relevant for practitioners and developing enforceable standards of conduct. Khurana, drawing on a rich set of archival material from business schools, foundations, and academic associations, traces how business educators confronted these challenges with varying strategies during the Progressive era and the Depression, the postwar boom years, and recent decades of freewheeling capitalism. Today, Khurana argues, business schools have largely capitulated in the battle for professionalism and have become merely purveyors of a product, the MBA, with students treated as consumers. Professional and moral ideals that once animated and inspired business schools have been conquered by a perspective that managers are merely agents of shareholders, beholden only to the cause of share profits. According to Khurana, we should not thus be surprised at the rise of corporate malfeasance. The time has come, he concludes, to rejuvenate intellectually and morally the training of our future business leaders.", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 8, "citationCount": 478, "influentialCitationCount": 8, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science", "Sociology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Political Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Sociology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2010-04-11", "journal": {"name": "Introductory Chapters", "volume": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Khurana2010IntroductionTF,\n author = {R.

Rakesh Khurana shows that university-based business schools were founded to train a professional class of managers in the mold of doctors and lawyers but have effectively retreated from that goal, leaving a gaping moral hole at the center of business education and perhaps in management itself. Khurana begins in the late nineteenth century, when members of an emerging managerial elite, seeking social status to match the wealth and power they had accrued, began working with major universities to establish graduate business education programs paralleling those for medicine and law. Constituting business as a profession, however, required codifying the knowledge relevant for practitioners and developing enforceable standards of conduct. Khurana, drawing on a rich set of archival material from business schools, foundations, and academic associations, traces how business educators confronted these challenges with varying strategies during the Progressive era and the Depression, the postwar boom years, and recent decades of freewheeling capitalism. Today, Khurana argues, business schools have largely capitulated in the battle for professionalism and have become merely purveyors of a product, the MBA, with students treated as consumers. Professional and moral ideals that once animated and inspired business schools have been conquered by a perspective that managers are merely agents of shareholders, beholden only to the cause of share profits. According to Khurana, we should not thus be surprised at the rise of corporate malfeasance. The time has come, he concludes, to rejuvenate intellectually and morally the training of our future business leaders.", "_authors": [{"_data": {"authorId": "38552278", "name": "R.

Respondents rated the importance of items relating to lifestyle and financial measures, which they used to judge their business success. Findings suggest that both financial and non-financial lifestyle criteria are used to judge business success, with the latter being more important.

Non-financial goals could lead to alternative measures of success, particularly in the small business sector. To explore the significance of these two dimensions of success, 290 small business owner-managers in Western Australia were surveyed. Respondents rated the importance of items relating to lifestyle and financial measures, which they used to judge their business success. Findings suggest that both financial and non-financial lifestyle criteria are used to judge business success, with the latter being more important.

(2) How do aspects of IT projects (specifically, quality of IT project planning and implementation problems in IT projects) mediate the relationship between business-IT strategic alignment and business effects of IT? Results from a survey of 274 senior information officers indicate that organizational emphasis on knowledge management and centralization of IT decisions affect top managers' knowledge of IT, which facilitates business managers' participation in strategic IT planning and IT managers' participation in business planning, and both of these planning behaviors affect business-IT strategic alignment. Moreover, the results indicate that quality of IT project planning and implementation problems in IT projects mediate the relationship between business-IT strategic alignment and business effect of IT. These findings highlight the importance of considering the planning and implementation of IT projects when examining the effects of business-IT strategic alignment, and highlight the importance of considering shared domain knowledge (i.e., top managers' knowledge of IT) and planning behaviors when examining the effects of contextual factors on business-IT strategic alignment.

We base the study in a routine-based perspective on business dynamics. We develop and test hypotheses concerning the relative extent of change by acquiring and non-acquiring businesses, focusing on product line addition, retention, and deletion as forms of changing resources.

This field research seeks empirically to explore the problems of implementing reengineering projects and how the severity of these problems relates to BPR project success. Based on past theories and research related to the implementation of organizational change as well as field experience of reengineering experts, a comprehensive list of sixty-four BPR implementation problems was identified. The severity of each problem was then rated by those who have participated in reengineering in 105 organizations. Analysis of the results clearly demonstrates the central importance of change management in BPR implementation success. Resolutions of problems in other areas such as technological competence and project planning were also determined to be necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for reengineering success. Further, problems that are more directly related to the conduct of a project such as process delineation, project management, and tactical planning were perceived as less difficult, yet highly related to project success. This situation was also true for human resource problems such as training personnel for the redesigned process. These findings suggest that reengineering project implementation is complex, involving many factors. To succeed, it is essential that change be managed and that balanced attention be paid to all identified factors, including those that are more contextual (e.g., management support and technological competence) as well as factors that pertain directly to the conduct of the project (e.g., project management and process delineation).

This field research seeks empirically to explore the problems of implementing reengineering projects and how the severity of these problems relates to BPR project success. Based on past theories and research related to the implementation of organizational change as well as field experience of reengineering experts, a comprehensive list of sixty-four BPR implementation problems was identified. The severity of each problem was then rated by those who have participated in reengineering in 105 organizations. Analysis of the results clearly demonstrates the central importance of change management in BPR implementation success. Resolutions of problems in other areas such as technological competence and project planning were also determined to be necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for reengineering success. Further, problems that are more directly related to the conduct of a project such as process delineation, project management, and tactical planning were perceived as less difficult, yet highly related to project success. This situation was also true for human resource problems such as training personnel for the redesigned process. These findings suggest that reengineering project implementation is complex, involving many factors. To succeed, it is essential that change be managed and that balanced attention be paid to all identified factors, including those that are more contextual (e.g., management support and technological competence) as well as factors that pertain directly to the conduct of the project (e.g., project management and process delineation).
